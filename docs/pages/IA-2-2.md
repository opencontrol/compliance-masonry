### AWS Multifactor Authentication  
* AWS multifactor authentication (MFA) for non-privileged users of the AWS console is implemented. This service has been configured for 18F administrative accounts in AWS IAM.  
* 18F implements the use of multifactor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security for login access to the AWS management console. With MFA enabled, all 18F users are prompted for a username and password, as well as the authentication code from their AWS MFA device.  
  
### Cloud Foundry User Identification and Authentication  
* Although Cloud Foundry does not currently have a MFA mechanism implemented yet, to gain access, a non-privileged user would need to first log into the AWS Management console and provide the authentication code from their AWS MFA device.  
* In addition, the Cloud Foundry PaaS is only accessible internally within the 18F environment and is not publically accessible to anyone outside this environment. Only 18F developers have access to the Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service.  
* Cloud Foundry currently utilizes username and password for identification and authentication. The Implementation of Duo Security MFA support using SAML 2.O federation is planned for an additional layered security approach.  
  
### Operating System (EC2) Multifactor Authentication  
* Non-privileged AWS accounts are not utilized for operating system components of AWS.
