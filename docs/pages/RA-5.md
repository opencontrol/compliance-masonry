### Operating System & Web Application (EC2) Vulnerabilit  y Scanning & interoperability  
* Nessus, and AlienVault USM for AWS utilize tools and techniques that promote interoperability such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 (CVSS2), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), and Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE). Tenable SecurityCenter is able to output reports in CyberScope format to meet NIST, DHS, and GSA reporting requirements.  
* OWASP Zap is used for web application scanning of hosted web sites and web based applications. It scans for the OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities and utilize tools and techniques that promote interoperability such as Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 (CVSS2), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), and Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE).
