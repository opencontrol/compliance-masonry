    - DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs) is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates; compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and approved state. 
    - AWS Cloud Formation templates are the approved baseline for all changes to the infrastructure and simplify provisioning and management on AWS. They provide an automated method to assess the status of an operational infrastructure against an approved baseline.

    - 18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings. Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way developers control revisions to source code. 
    - 18F uses several version control systems(i.e. AWS Config, AWS Service Catalog) with its templates to know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of a template.
