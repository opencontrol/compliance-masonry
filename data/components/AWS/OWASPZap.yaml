      a: "OWASP Zap is used to conduct web Application scanning primarily \nfor the\
        \ OWASP Top 10. 18F uses it as an integrated security testing tool for finding\
        \ vulnerabilities in web applications. 18F will provide more automated functionally\
        \ of security tests using OWASP ZAP and Jenkins for its \nsoftware development\
        \ lifecycle and continuous integration functions.\n"
      b: "OWASP Zap is used for web application scanning of hosted websites \nand\
