      a: '- Elastic Block Storage access is managed through the use of IAM Roles which

      g: '- 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch for its system account monitoring.
        It allows 18F to monitor AWS resources in near real-time, including Amazon
        EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon RDS
        DB instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and request counts
        are provided automatically for these AWS resources. It allows 18F to supply
        logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage, transaction
        volumes, or error rates.

    CM-2: DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and
      AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration
      management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration
      of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs)
      is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates;
      compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and
      approved state.
    CM-6:
      a: '- DevOps and Security Engineers maintain the baseline configuration for
        VPC, EBS and AMIs.  Best practices, FISMA compliant AMIs are utilized as there
        are no benchmarks available.
