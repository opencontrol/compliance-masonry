      - Nessus will be used conduct internal scanning of its VPC and private subnets within the 18F Virtual Private Cloud.
      - 18F runs Nessus (Authenticated) scans of the Cloud Foundry environment weekly based on IP ranges in use. These scans include network discovery and vulnerability checks of operating systems, server software, and any supporting components or applications. Scans are automatically compared to previous scans to identify new vulnerabilities or changes which resolve previously identified vulnerabilities. Nessus reports are reviewed at least weekly and appropriate actions taken on discovery of vulnerabilities.
      - Nessus is used to run (Authenticated) scans when a new host/AMI/Stemcell is built.  This scan determines baseline posture used to contribute to decision of Production acceptance.  Additionally, this tool is used to execute CIS benchmark compliance scans when actively working to address configuration and hardening requirements.
