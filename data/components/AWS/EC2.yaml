      - Access to Amazon EC2 Linux instances are managed by the use of EC2 key pairs and using SSH to access the local instance on the individual Linux, or appliance instance. Account types include individual user and system/application user accounts. Shared or group accounts are not permitted outside of default accounts such as local Administrators or root. There are no guest/anonymous or temporary user accounts.
      - Operating System user groups are documented in section 9.1 Types of Users.
      - Initial Linux local root access is provided to AWS administrator account users only if they provide the key pair assigned to the Linux EC2 instance and login using SSH.
    f: |
      - Local system user account establishment, activation, modification, disablement or removal requires approval by the managing 18F project lead and Cloud Foundry Information System Technical Point of Contact (Operating Environment).

      - 18F has implemented AWS CloudWatch for basic monitoring of Amazon EC2 instances. Basic Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: Seven pre-selected metrics at five-minute frequency and three status check metrics at one-minute frequency.
      - 18F has implemented Detailed Monitoring for Amazon EC2 instances: All metrics available to Basic Monitoring at one-minute frequency. Instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled allow data aggregation by Amazon EC2 AMI ID and instance type.
      - 18F has implemented the use of Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing where Amazon CloudWatch provides Amazon EC2 instance metrics aggregated by Auto Scaling groups and Elastic Load Balancers.
      - Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if AWS resources have been terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the metrics preceding an event of interest.
      - Metrics are accessed in either the Amazon EC2 tab or the Amazon CloudWatch tab of the AWS Management Console, or by using the Amazon CloudWatch API.
    h: |
      - Local system user accounts will be deactivated immediately on receipt of notification of an email from the managing 18F project lead or at a future date as directed.
      - User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity.
    i: |
      - System access to local EC2 instance accounts is provided only to those with an established need to manage servers in the Cloud Foundry environment. User group membership is restricted to the least privilege necessary for the user to accomplish their assigned duties
    j: |
      - User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity.
      - Linux accounts will be monitored via scripts which query the last logon date/time of each user account and provide the results in the form of a CSV file which an authorized administrator will use for the basis of disablement.
      - Application accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process, but the disablement will be automatic.

      - 18F has implemented AWS CloudTrail for monitoring Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC that captures API calls and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, all CloudTrail log files are encrypted by using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE)
      - With CloudTrail logging enabled, API calls made to Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC actions are tracked in log files, along with any other AWS service records. CloudTrail determines when to create and write to a new file based on a specified time period and file size.

  CM-2: DevOps maintain baseline configurations for VPC, EBS, EC2 instances and AMIs. AWS Cloud Formation templates help 18F maintain a strict configuration management scheme of the cloud infrastructure. If an error or misconfiguration of the infrastructure or associated security mechanism (security groups, NACLs) is detected, the administrators can analyze the current infrastructure templates; compare with previous versions, and redeploy the configurations to a known and approved state.
  CM-8:
    a: |
      - AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of all 18F AWS resources and their current configuration, and continuously records configuration changes (e.g., the value of tags on Amazon EC2 instances, ingress/egress rules of security groups, and Network ACL rules for VPCs).
  IA-2: |
    - Additional temporary permission are delegated with the IAM roles usually for applications that run on EC2 Instanc.es in order to access AWS resources (i.e. Amazon S3 buckets, DynamoDB data)
  IA-2 (1): |
    - Although the EC2 instances do not natively have a MFA mechanism, to gain access a privileged user would need to first log into the AWS Management console and provide the authentication code from their AWS MFA device.
  IA-2 (2): |
    - Non-privileged AWS accounts are not utilized for operating system components of AWS
  IA-2 (12): |
    - Although the EC2 instances do not utilize PIV credentials, Agency privileged/non-privilege users need to first log into GSA GFEs and network using their PIV credentials, which does leverage x509 certificates combined with usernames and one-time passwords to provide multi-factor authentication.
  SC-7:
    a: |
      - Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks. All of the AWS APIs are available via SSL-protected endpoints which provide server authentication. Amazon EC2 AMIs automatically generate new SSH host certificates on first boot and log them to the instance’s console. 18F can then use the secure APIs to call the console and access the host certificates before logging into the instance for the first time. 18F uses SSL for all interactions with AWS.
      - IP Spoofing. Amazon EC2 instances cannot send spoofed network traffic. The AWS-controlled, host-based firewall infrastructure will not permit an instance to send traffic with a source IP or MAC address other than its own.
      - Amazon EC2 provides a complete firewall solution; this mandatory inbound firewall is configured in a default deny-all mode and Amazon EC2 customers must explicitly open the ports needed to allow inbound traffic. The traffic may be restricted by protocol, by service port, as well as by source IP address (individual IP or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block).
