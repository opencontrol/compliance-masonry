    SI-4:
      c: "- HM9000 is essential to ensuring that apps running on Cloud Foundry remain\
        \ available. HM9000 restarts applications whenever the DEA running an app\
        \ shuts down for any reason, when Warden kills the app because it violated\
        \ a quota, or when the application process exits with a non-zero exit code\n\
        - Cloud Foundry application monitoring component HM9000 (Health Manager) has\
        \ four core responsibilities:\n- Monitor applications to determine their state\
        \ (e.g. running, stopped, crashed, etc.), version, and number of instances.\
        \ HM9000 updates the actual state of an application based on heartbeats and\
        \ droplet.exited messages issued by the DEA running the application.\n- Determine\
        \ applications\u2019 expected state, version, and number of instances. HM9000\
        \ obtains the desired state of an application from a dump of the Cloud Controller\
        \ database.\n- Reconcile the actual state of applications with their expected\
        \ state. For instance, if fewer than expected instances are running, HM9000\
        \ will instruct the Cloud Controller to start the appropriate number of instances.\n\
        - Direct Cloud Controller to take action to correct any discrepancies in the\
        \ state of applications.\n"
